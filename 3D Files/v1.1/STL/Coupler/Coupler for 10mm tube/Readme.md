# New couplers for 10mm Y axis tube with 8mm ID

**This is a test!**

**We do not reccomend using 10mm tubes. The other parts are made for a 12mm tube!**

**Added different tolerance options**

- Motor shaft is tight by design. 
- If it does not fit, either file it or heat up the shaft with a lighter and push the coupler in it.
